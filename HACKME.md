For a brief moment, Dr. Dexter felt guilty for rejecting Roger's idea and decided to apologize. He wrote a letter addressed to Roger, explaining why he had not initially trusted his idea and how wrong he had been. However, he quickly realized that his ego was hurt and shredded the letter.

Now, the flag is lost among the shreds, unless you can piece it back together.

Some clues from Roger:
- Dr. Dexter writes in flawless English: he uses only words from words_alpha.txt, which he has memorized entirely.
- His punctuation is minimal: he only uses commas (",") and periods (".").
- He has an OCD: every new line (not just every paragraph) he writes must start with a word that is at least four characters long.

If it's helpful, another shredded letter (with no flag) from Dr. Dexter is included. This one was also shredded the same way, but Ned (aka Zain) was able to piece it back together.
