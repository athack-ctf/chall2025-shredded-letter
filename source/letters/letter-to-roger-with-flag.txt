DEAR STUDENT OF MINE,
UNCOMMON AS IT IS FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME TO ADMIT ANY FAULT, BUT I FIND MYSELF IN A PECULIAR POSITION
ALAS. THERE WAS A TIME, NOT SO LONG AGO, WHEN I LOOKED AT YOUR WORK WITH DISDAIN, WHEN I SAW IT AS
LITTLE MORE THAN A MISGUIDED, FRIVOLOUS EXPERIMENT WITH NO REAL MERIT OR VALUE. IN MY ARROGANCE, I
THOUGHT YOUR PROJECT WAS DESTINED TO FAIL, A FUTILE EXERCISE IN FUTILITY. PERHAPS, I WAS TOO QUICK
DISMISSING IT, TOO BLINDED BY MY OWN CONFIDENCE IN MY UNDERSTANDING OF THESE MATTERS. PROTONS, OR
PROTEINS, THE VERY CORE OF THE IDEAS YOU WERE GRAPPLING WITH, I THOUGHT WERE BEYOND YOUR REACH.
CERTAINLY, YOU LACKED THE SKILL TO MAKE ANY SENSE OF THESE COMPLEX CONCEPTS, LET ALONE MASTER THEM.
HOWEVER, IN HINDSIGHT, I SEE I WAS MISTAKEN. HERE WE ARE, AND I MUST ADMIT, AGAINST ALL MY
EXPECTATIONS, YOU HAVE DONE IT. THE RESULTS ARE IMPRESSIVE, IN THEIR OWN RIGHT, THOUGH I AM NOT
EASY TO SHOW ANY KIND OF ENTHUSIASM OR APPROVAL. BUT I WILL SAY THAT YOU HAVE PROVEN ME WRONG, AND
THAT, IN ITSELF, IS NO SMALL FEAT.
WHAT I ONCE THOUGHT IMPOSSIBLE, YOU HAVE ACHIEVED, AND FOR THAT, I SUPPOSE I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY. I
SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE OPEN TO THE POTENTIAL OF YOUR WORK, EVEN IF IT SEEMED ILLOGICAL AT FIRST. I
BLINDED BY MY OWN ARROGANCE, I WAS UNABLE TO RECOGNIZE WHAT YOU WERE CAPABLE OF. HOWEVER, IN
HINDSIGHT, I CAN NOT HELP BUT WONDER IF THE LACK OF SUPPORT DURING THAT CRUCIAL MOMENT HELD YOU BACK
MORE THAN I INTENDED.
THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE, OF COURSE, WHO SEEMED MORE EAGER TO CLAIM THE CREDITS FOR YOUR IDEAS. I WILL
MENTION NO NAME, BUT IT IS CLEAR TO ME NOW THAT I DID MISJUDGE THE SITUATION. IT IS NOT THAT, I WAS
WRONG ABOUT THE RISKS, IT IS JUST THAT YOU, IN YOUR PERSISTENCE, WERE ABLE TO TURN THOSE RISKS INTO
SOMETHING WORTHWHILE. AND FOR THAT, YOU DESERVE RECOGNITION.
START BY LOOKING AT THE FIRST WORD OF EVERY PARAGRAPH. TAKE THESE WORDS AND CONCATENATE THEM, USING
UNDERSCORES AS SEPARATORS. ONCE YOU HAVE GATHERED THEM, WRAP THE STRING IN CURLY BRACKETS. FINALLY,
FORGET NOT TO ADD THE USUAL PREFIX, THE ONE THAT REMINDS YOU OF THE BEST ONE OF THE BEST CYBER
SECURITY COMPETITIONS THAT EVER HAPPENED IN CANADA. SHOULD YOU FOLLOW THIS METHOD, YOU WILL
OBTAIN THE SECRET YOU HAVE COME LOOKING FOR. IT IS A FLAG I WILL PROBABLY SHRED LATER, OUT OF
REGRETTING HAVING REGRETS.
THIS IS NOT AN EASY THING FOR ME TO SAY, BUT PERHAPS YOU HAVE EARNED IT. I WILL LEAVE IT TO YOU TO
DECIDE WHETHER MY ACKNOWLEDGMENT MEANS ANYTHING. IN ALL CASES, I TRUST YOU WILL CONTINUE YOUR LABOR,
EVEN IF YOU CHOOSE TO DISREGARD MY GUIDANCE IN THE FUTURE. AFTER ALL, I HAVE ALREADY SEEN WHAT YOU
COULD BE CAPABLE OF.
DOCTOR. DEXTER.
